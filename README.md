# Arterial line study in MIMIC-III

This repository reproduces a study on the impact of arterial line catheters on mortality in the ICU. The study was originally performed in MIMIC-II, this repository extends it to MIMIC-III, a more recent instantiation of data collected from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

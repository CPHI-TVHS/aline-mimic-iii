# Arterial line study in MIMIC-III

This repository reproduces a study on the impact of arterial line catheters on mortality in the ICU. The study was originally performed in MIMIC-II, this repository extends it to MIMIC-III, a more recent instantiation of data collected from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

NB: All scripts in the sql folder are symlinked in the docs folder, which is served publicly with GitHub pages. These pages are linked from the HST-953 repository, so changing the filename is discouraged (and if filenames do change, please update the HST-953 repository!).

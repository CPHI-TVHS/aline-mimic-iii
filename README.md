# Arterial line study in MIMIC-III

This repository reproduces a study on the impact of arterial line catheters on mortality in the ICU. The study was originally performed in MIMIC-II, this repository extends it to MIMIC-III, a more recent instantiation of data collected from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

NB: All scripts in the sql folder are duplicated in the HST-953 course repository at: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/hst-953. Any updates made to the scripts will need to be manually copied to the HST-953 repository (at [/docs/sql/](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/hst-953/tree/master/docs)).
